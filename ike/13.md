# `0x13` Sensors

Cluster `0x80` → Broadcast `0xbf`

This command changed during production. Specifically, four bytes were appended to the bitfield, taking it's size from three bytes to seven bytes.

The earliest example I've seen of the increased size was an IKI (Oct 01), which might suggest the change occured with introduction of IKI (Sep 97), or with the 1998 production break (PU98), which marked the transition from M52 (MS41), to M52TU (MS42) etc.

The examples I've seen appear to be backwards compatible.

## Parameters

**The longer variant of the command is not covered!**

Fixed length. 3 byte bit field.

    HANDBRAKE       = 0b0000_0001 << 16
    OIL_PRESSURE    = 0b0000_0010 << 16
    BRAKE_PADS      = 0b0000_0100 << 16
    TRANSMISSION    = 0b0001_0000 << 16
    
    IGNITION        = 0b0000_0001 << 8
    DOOR            = 0b0000_0010 << 8
    GEAR            = 0b1111_0000 << 8

    AUX_VENT        = 0b0000_1000
    
    # Aux. Heat direct?
    
    # IKI (E39-KMBI_E38.C12)
    # Fuel tank lid open warning?
    # Seat belt warning?

### Handbrake `0b0000_0001 << 16`

Microswitch located on the handbrake mechanism.

    HANDBRAKE_OFF    = 0
    HANDBRAKE_ON     = 1

### Oil Pressure `0b0000_0010 << 16`

This mirrors the cluster's oil pressure warning lamp behaviour. As such, a fault will be indicated at KL-15 until ignition, at which point oil pressure (should) be obtained.

    OIL_PRESSURE_OK     = 0
    OIL_PRESSURE_FAULT  = 1
    
### Brake Pads `0b0000_0100 << 16`

Brake pad wear sensors.

In the case of the E39, there are two sensors. Front left brake pad sensor [B16], rear right brake pad sensor [B17].

    BRAKE_PADS_OK     = 0
    BRAKE_PADS_FAULT  = 1

### Transmission `0b0000_0100 << 16`

*Transmission Emergency Program*.

    TRANSMISSION_OK     = 0
    TRANSMISSION_FAULT  = 1
   
---

### Ignition `0b0000_0001 << 8`

Denotes that the engine is running.

    IGNITION_OFF    = 0
    IGNITION_ON     = 1     # Engine running

### Door `0b0000_0010 << 8`

Replicates the driver's door open field of `0x7a`.

    DOOR_CLOSED = 0
    DOOR_OPEN   = 1     # Driver's door open

### Gear `0b1111_0000 << 8`

Only at KL-15 and above. Presumably doesn't apply to manual transmissions, but may apply to SMG.

    GEAR_NONE       = 0b0000_0000   # KL-30/KL-R
    GEAR_PARK       = 0b1011_0000
    GEAR_REVERSE    = 0b0001_0000
    GEAR_NEUTRAL    = 0b0111_0000
    GEAR_DRIVE      = 0b1000_0000
    GEAR_FIRST      = 0b0010_0000
    GEAR_SECOND     = 0b0110_0000
    GEAR_THIRD      = 0b1101_0000
    GEAR_FOURTH     = 0b1100_0000
    GEAR_FIFTH      = 0b1110_0000
    GEAR_SIXTH      = 0b1111_0000   # Only a guess!

---

### Aux. Ventilation `0b0000_1000`

Activation of aux. ventilation.

    AUX_VENT_OFF    = 0
    AUX_VENT_ON     = 1

## Use Cases

### Check Control

> The check control receives information from the IKE for the following messages.
>
> - Transmission emergency program
> - Release parking brake> - Check brake pad> - Stop! Engine oil pressure

The driver's door warning is activated by the door status reported with `0x7a`.

### PDC

In the case of automatic vehicles, PDC activation is dependent on gear. For example, rear PDC will activate when reverse gear is selected.

### Aux. Heating/Ventilation

The cluster is responsible for control of aux. ventilation and heating. Both modes of activation- timer and direct, are accomplished with this command.
