# `0x51` Check Control Status

CCM `0x30` → Broadcast `0xbf`

*Only applies to low cluster (KOMBI)!*

![Check Control Overview](51/cc.jpg)

The Check Control Module (CCM) reports certain sensors to cluster, such as *Washer Fluid Low*, *Brake Fluid Low* etc. Later models, like the E46 have all these sensors connected directly to the IKE.

Note: The CCM was originally a discrete module in early E38s, but it was soon integrated into the light module which is found on later E38s, E39s, E46 etc.

## Use Cases

### Indicator and warning lamps

> Many of the systems of your BMW monitor themselves automatically, both during engine starts and while you are driving. Indicator and warning lamps that are identified by "●" are tested for proper functioning whenever the ignition key is turned. They each light up once for different periods of time.

#### Brake Fluid
